## Mission

Give or improve participant's experience of:

1. self paced learning.
1. team work and communication.
1. peer review.

## Primary written language

ENGLISH

## Preferable programming language

1. ANY LANGUAGE PERMITTED.
1. Except brainf*k
1. Malbolge permitted

Here explanation needed. Hence we are driven to improve our code writing and code reading the participant should take the responsibility to explain all the staff to his fellow kottan reviewer. Just be nice and patient in your explanation and attempts to understand.

## Learning material

- **[OSS Stanford Algorithm course](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/)**
- Skiena's book or for additional tasks

## Meeting Schedule

- twice per week in co-working

## Group size

- expecting 10 max 15 people
- for each part of course there will be division into sub-groups
- optimistic drop-out rate 40%
> at the end we will invite to the alumni party all those who didn't make it to cheer you, as you actually made an effort to start and that deserves admiration ;)

### Activities between meetings

- read\watch learn
- infinite online\offline communication;
- sub-group communication on

### Activities during  offline-meetings

- peer review;
- each sub group prepares mini-task from **placeholder_algorithm_book** and present the story of solution;
    >| Concerns:| -- | How to deal with|
    >|--------- | -- | ----------------|
    >| presentation equipment within co-working | -- | needs facility investigation
    >| time limit during meetings | -- | 10 minutes * 15/2 group number == 75 minutes. decline time to 5 minutes or make this activity optional |
    >| public speaking feare | -- | make this activity optional |



- task discussion;

## Peer review procedure

>**here discussion appreciated**

1. the one, who participate make fork of this repo
1. the one, who participate create a folder in `/tasks/%username%` location
    1. to track activity i'd(@Quodnon) urge to open **PR** prior to actually creating the solution.
    1. If someone is stuck with his task, there is always a helping hand of fellow kottan;
    1. that also means we shouldn't **watch** the repo, as there will be tons of notifications;
1. each task is done in own fork and then a pull-request made to kottans repo
1. Pull request is sent for review to fellow kottan - each new **PR** to **next** kottan;
1. ???? - means review here
1. Pull request accepted and those from group who have write access merge PR to master;
